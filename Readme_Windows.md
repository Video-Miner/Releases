The installer will create start menu shortcuts named Start Video Miner Pool, Stop Video Miner Pool, and View Video Miner Pool Logs. We recommend pinning these for easy access. 

## MANUALLY PATCHING

2. Run ApplyPatch.exe

3. Click Yes to Allow App to make changes.

4. Find your Nvidia DLL. There should be a field populated with ```C:\WINDOWS\system32\nvEncodeAPI64.dll```. If not, choose Browse for Nvidia DLL and find nvEncodeAPI64.dll in ```C:\WINDOWS\system32\```.

5. Download the correct patch for your driver version. By default, the patch program will attempt to detect the correct patch and place the URL in the field next to Download Patch. 
    * 5a. Click Download Patch. If you receive an error stating your patch could not be found, or if the field is empty, proceed to step 7.

6. Click Apply Patch.

7. If you receive an error, you'll need to manually find the correct patch for your drivers. This is common when using Studio drivers. In the patching app, you should see your driver version listed.
